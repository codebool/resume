        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey there! I'm Bo Qu, also you can call me Miles. Currently, I'm on an exciting journey at Algonquin
            College,
            diving deep into the world of Computer Programming. With a background in economics, I've got a unique mix of
            number-crunching skills and coding prowess.
            When I'm not glued to my screen debugging the next big thing, you'll find me out in nature, hiking and
            soaking up the great outdoors.
            I'm also a chess aficionado â€“ nothing beats the thrill of a good strategic showdown!
            And if I'm not playing chess, I'm probably lost in a science fiction novel, dreaming of galaxies far, far
            away.
            Oh, and did I mention my love for all things tech? Whether it's building cool projects, automating tasks, or
            exploring the latest in tech trends, I'm always game for some techy fun.
            So, stick around, explore, and let's geek out together!
        </p>
